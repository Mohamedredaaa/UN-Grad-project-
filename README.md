## About the Project

Car ownership transfer is often a lengthy and complex process that requires multiple intermediaries and carries the risk of fraud. Enjaz aims to address these issues by providing a blockchain-based platform where car ownership can be transferred securely and transparently via smart contracts. With Enjaz, all transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring full traceability and trust.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Automation**: Automates the transfer of car ownership upon meeting specific conditions.
- **Blockchain Security**: Ensures all data is securely stored and resistant to tampering.
- **Transparent Transactions**: Provides a clear, transparent record of all ownership transfers.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Reduces reliance on centralized institutions and minimizes transaction delays.
- **Fraud Prevention**: Minimizes fraud risk through secure identity verification and transaction verification mechanisms.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum (or any other compatible blockchain network)
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity
- **Frontend**: React (or another frontend framework of choice)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API handling
- **Database**: IPFS for decentralized storage or MongoDB for additional data storage
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask or other Ethereum-compatible wallets

## Project Architecture

The Enjaz system is divided into several key components:

1. **Smart Contract Layer**: Manages the car ownership transfer logic, handling ownership verification, payments, and transaction approvals.
2. **Backend API**: A Node.js/Express server that interacts with the blockchain and database, providing endpoints for frontend and wallet integration.
3. **Frontend Application**: Provides a user interface for buyers and sellers to initiate, view, and confirm ownership transfers.
4. **Blockchain Network**: Ethereum (or compatible blockchain) hosts the smart contracts, ensuring secure and decentralized transaction storage.
5. **IPFS / MongoDB**: Stores metadata, such as car details and transfer documentation, in a secure and decentralized manner.

## Installation
